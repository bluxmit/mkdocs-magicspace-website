## Build 

The first thing to do - is to build static documentation website from our project. Cd to the Mkdocs project folder, and execute 

```
mkdocs build -d /home/static-server/my-website
```

Static HTML website was built, and you can use Static File Server (a tool that comes installed in the Mkdocs-MagicSpace) to view 
the ready documentation.

Done! Your static documentation website is ready. You can deploy it on any service that allows to serve HTML websites.   

!!! info
    You don't really need Mkdocs-MagicSpace to serve a static HTML website. You can publish it on any web hosting service. 
    Mkdocs-MagicSpace can also do that. In fact, Mkdocs-MagicSpace comes together with the server for static websites (Static 
    File Server). In this tutorial we will explain how to do that.

## Get a server

For the documentation website to be online all the time, you need to get a cloud server. There are lots of cloud providers where 
you can buy a server easily, for instance [digitalocean.com](https://digitalocean.com), [linode.com](https://linode.com), [vultr.com](https://vultr.com), etc. 
You can also use services of *"big clouds"* like AWS, Google Cloud, MS Azure, etc., but it is harder if you are not familiar with any of them.  

Serving static website requires little resources, even if scale out Mkdocs-MagicSpace, and run several workspaces to ensure 
higher concurrency and better performance for your users. Server with 2 (V)CPU and 4 GB RAM will be enough. It usually costs around 5$ per month.  

**NOTE:** The server should have public IP in order to be accessible in the Internet.  

!!! tip
    If possible, chose server option that aleady has docker installed. Many cloud services already provide them.

!!! tip
    I recommend to choose Ubuntu as OS 


If the server does not come with docker, we need to install it. [Install docker on Ubuntu 18](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/), 
and [install docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Domain name

In order to publish your documentation website you need to get a domain name. There are a lot of services where you can do that, 
for example [name.com](https://name.com), [namecheap.com](https://namecheap.com) etc.   

After you buy a domain name, find in the website of your domain provider how to add ***"A-record"*** that will point to the ***IP*** 
of your server.   

This is how it looks on [name.com](https://name.com)

## Deploy

In order to deploy documentation website with Mkdocs-MagicSpace you will need to perform only the following 2 steps:

1. Get workspace image on the cloud server
2. Launch workspace in production

### Get workspace image on the cloud server

Commiting workspace - is creating a new docker image from your workspace with all the work and changes you've done in this workspace. 
After image is created, you will be able to create many copies of your workspace from this image. You can also create different 
versions of your workspace by committing at different moments of time.  

In oder to commit image open terminal on the server, laptop or PC where worrkspace is running. Assuming the name of your 
workspace is **space-1**, execute 

```
docker commit space-1 ready-website:0.1
```

where *0.1* is a version.  

Unless you are already developing in the remote workspace on the same server you want to deploy your documentation website, 
you will need to get the image of this workspace on the remote server. The best way - is to use private docker registry, that 
you can buy from many docker registry providers and cloud services (you can buy it even on [hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com/) itself)   

!!! warning
    It is not recommended to use free public docker registry, because it is ***public***, 
    and anyone can pull and open your workspace. 

I've got a private registry on docker hub, called alnoda/ready-website, and pushing image to the registry is as easy as 

```
docker tag ready-website:0.1 alnoda/ready-website:0.1
docker push alnoda/ready-website:0.1
```

On the colud server I simply login to the docker registry, and execute 

```
docker pull alnoda/ready-website:0.1
```

Easy! Now workspace image with the documentation website is on the cloud server ready to be deployed.  

### Launch workspace in production

We use [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/https/tls/) to take care of TLS certificates and HTTPS. That is the reason why we start 
workspace in production together with Traefic service using docker-compose.   

!!! tip
    Configuring load balancer/reverse proxy is not an extremely easy task, that's why Mkdocs-MagicSpace comes with a small 
    utility that will do it for you. 
    
In order to generate a production-ready `docker-compose.yml` file, open terminal in the running Mkdocs-MagicSpace, and execute 

```
python /home/abc/utils/staticserver.py --image="alnoda/ready-website:0.1" --domain="<YOUR DOMAIN>" --email="<YOUR EMAIL>" --homepage="my-website/"
```

**NOTE:** argument --homepage="my-website/" is a path to the website in the Static File Server

![Placeholder](img/sfs-path.png){style="height: 50%; width: 50%; border-radius: 5px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;" loading=lazy}

You see that a file `docker-compose.yml` is generated. Copy this file to the cloud server, and execute 

```
docker-compose up -d
```

You are live! Open your browser, and navigate to your domain.
