Make your docs look classy and fun to read by using beautiful icons and emoji. There are thousands of them, and youwill always find what you need.

Yo can include emoji in your tmarkdown ext using special words.

2. :material-alien-outline: - **Material Design Icons**
2. :octicons-rocket-24: - **Octicons**

    ![Placeholder](img/fontawesome.png){style="box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.24) 2px 0px 5px;"}

## Superscipt & Subscript
Wrap text around both sides with ```^``` to make it look like a superscript
!!! example "Superscript"
    === "Output"
        Sin^2^ + Cos^2^ = 1  

        2^e^

        ^$^80

        Googol = 10^100^

    === "Markdown"
        ```
        Sin^2^ + Cos^2^ = 1  

        2^e^

        ^$^80

        Googol = 10^100^
        ```

Wrap text around both sides with ```~``` to make it look like a subscript
!!! example "Subscript"
    === "Output"
        C~hex~ = 12~dec~ = 14~oct~

        C~2~H~5~0H 

        ^67^/~68~

    === "Markdown"
        ```
        C~hex~ = 12~dec~ = 14~oct~ 

        C~2~H~5~0H 

        ^67^/~68~
        ```


## Critic
- to {++insert text++} use \{\+\+insert text\+\+\} 
- to {--remove text--} use \{\-\-remove text\-\-\}
- to {~~substitute this~>with this~~} use \{\~\~substitute this\~\>with this\~\~\}
- to {==highlight text==} use \{\=\=highlight text\=\=\}
- to {==highlight text==}{>>with a comment<<} use \{\=\=highlight text\=\=}\{\>\>with a comment\<\<\}

!!! example "Critic"
    === "Output"
        We Uber drivers never know whom we’re going to end up with as a passenger {--in the same car--}. 
        One day, I was driving over a new bridge, the design of which was very {~~confusing~>ugly~~}. 
        Completely confounded, {==I muttered==}{>>Actually I said it out loud<<}, “I’d love to meet the {~~genius~>retard~~} 
        who designed this mess.” With that, my passenger {==extended his hand in my direction==}{>>I thought he wanted to choke me<<} 
        and said, “Well, today is your {--*very*--} lucky day. My name is Mike, I work for the county engineer’s office, 
        and I’m the {==genius==}{>>obviously an irony<<} who designed this!”. Surprisingly, he still gave me a tip {++**of 2 dollars**++}.

## Keys
You can create beautiful styles for keyboard keys and key combinations just like this: ```++ctrl++``` yields  ++ctrl++
