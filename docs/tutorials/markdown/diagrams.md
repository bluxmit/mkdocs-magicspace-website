Mermaid allows to use text syntaxis to create diagrams. Thus Mermaid diagrams can be part 
of Markdown documentation and have all the benefits of version control or can even be auto-generated using jinja2 templates.

!!! warning 
    In this tutorial we provide introduction to basic features of Mermaid, but they alrteady allow you to do a lot! 
    Check out [complete Mermaid docs](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/) to learn the full power.

## Pie chart
Very simple, just specify title and all entries with absolute Values

!!! example "State Diagram"
    === "Output"
        ```mermaid
        pie
            title Key elements in Product X
            "Calcium" : 42.96
            "Potassium" : 50.05
            "Magnesium" : 10.01
            "Iron" :  5
        ```

            "Iron" :  5
        ```

## Flow chart
All Flowcharts are composed of nodes, the geometric shapes and edges, the arrows or lines. 
The code defines the way how these nodes and edges are made and connected.

Nodes always have id, which is used to create links, and optionally nodes can have text inside. There is a selection of node shapes.
Links can have text and be of different type.  

Graph should have direction: **LR** (left-right) or **TD** (top-down).

    === "Output"
        ```mermaid
        graph TD

## Sequence diagram
Sequence diagram is used to demonstrate interactions between actors - elements of some system. 
It is perfect to show how processes operate with one another and in what order.   

This diagram is a list of communications in the form ```[Actor][Arrow][Actor]:Message text```

??? info "Types of arrows" 
    **Type** | **Description**
    :--- | --- 
    -> | Solid line without arrow
    --> | Dotted line without arrow
    ->> | Solid line with arrowhead
    -->> | Dotted line with arrowhead
    -x 	| Solid line with a cross at the end
    --x | Dotted line with a cross at the end.
    -) | Solid line with an open arrow at the end (async)
    --) | Dotted line with a open arrow at the end (async)

## Class diagram

Class diagram in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) describes the structure of a system by showing the system's classes, 
their attributes, operations (or methods), and the relationships between the objects.

## Entity Relationship Diagram

ERD diagrams allow documenting data end establishing relations between data collections.   
Each relation consists of the following parts: ```  <first-entity> <relationship> <second-entity> : <relationship-label>```, 
i.e. ```ORDER ||--|{ LINE_ITEM : contains``` .  

The relationship part of each statement can be broken down into three sub-components:

- the cardinality of the first entity with respect to the second,
- whether the relationship confers identity on a 'child' entity
- the cardinality of the second entity with respect to the first

Cardinality is a property that describes how many elements of another entity can be related to the entity in question. 
In the above example a ORDER can have one or more LINE_ITEM instances associated to it, 
whereas a LINE_ITEM can have one and only one ORDER. In each cardinality marker there are two characters. 
The outermost character represents a maximum value, and the innermost character represents a minimum value. 
The table below summarises possible cardinalities.


**Value (left)** | **Value (right)** | **Meaning**
:--- | --- | ---
```|o``` |	```o|``` | Zero or one
```||``` | ```||``` | Exactly one
```}o``` |	```o{``` |	Zero or more (no upper limit)
```}|``` |	```|{``` | One or more (no upper limit)

## User Journey Diagram
User journeys describe at a high level of detail exactly what steps different users take to complete 
a specific task within a system, application or website. This technique shows the current (as-is) 
user workflow, and reveals areas of improvement for the to-be workflow.   

Each user journey is split into sections, these describe the part of the task the user is trying to complete.
Tasks syntax is ```<Task name>: <score>: <comma separated list of actors>```

## Gantt diagram
Gantt Charts will record each scheduled task as one continuous bar that extends from the left to the right. 
The x axis represents time and the y records the different tasks and the order in which they are to be completed.  

Gantt chart consists of tasks grouped in sections. Every task has the folloving attributes 

**position** | **name** | **Optional** | **Values** 
:--- | --- | --- | ---

A Requirement diagram provides a visualization for requirements and their connections, to each other and other documented elements. 
The modeling specs follow those defined by SysML v1.6.

## State Diagram
State diagram - is a type of diagram used in computer science and related fields to describe the behavior of systems. 
State diagrams require that the system described is composed of a finite number of states; sometimes, this is indeed the case, 
while at other times this is a reasonable abstraction
