    MkDocs Workspace comes with many plugins and markdown extensions set up and configure. This workspace will save you a ton lot of time, 
    that you would otherwise waste on researching, fixing conflicts, and trying things out until they work.

## Workspace is in Docker

MkDocs Workspace was built from [Workspace-in-docker](https://github.com/bluxmit/alnoda-workspaces/tree/main/workspaces/workspace-in-docker), it has all the features that 
Workspace-in-docker has.  

Dockerfized Workspace encapsulates and isolates code, configuration files, assets, secrets, installed packages, and libraries for multiple programming languages, 
as well as system applications. It has features that allow working conveniently in a local or remote environment having the same experience. 
It does not influence your local environment in any way. Workspace is super-easy to set up, use, and delete.

Because workspace - is a group of applications running inside the docker container, you can develop on your laptop, 
as well as directly on the virtual server in any cloud. You can also start developing locally, and at any moment 
push the container to the remote server and vice versa.

    The very same docker container you use for development can be instantly committed, in order to create a docker image, which is ready for deployment. This 
    frees you from building new docker images for production, writing docker files, and taking care of dependencies.
